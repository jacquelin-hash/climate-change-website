                <p>
                    Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is the biggest cause of climate change. Massive volumes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases are released during these activities, trapping heat in the atmosphere and increasing global temperatures.

                <h4 class="intro-text left-align">2. Deforestation And Land Use Change</h4>
                <p>
                    Forests are essential for maintaining the Earth's climate balance because they absorb CO2. However, this capacity is diminished by extensive deforestation for logging, urbanization, and agriculture, which raises atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses.

                <h5 class="intro-text left-align">3. Industrial Activities</h5>
                <p>
                    Methane, nitrous oxide, and CO₂ are among the greenhouse gases released during manufacturing processes. The situation is exacerbated by the high energy use of sectors like steel, cement, and chemical manufacturing.

                <h6 class="intro-text left-align">4. Agriculture and Livestock</h6>
                <p>
                    Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is released in large quantities during agricultural operations, especially when livestock is raised. Nitrous oxide, another gas released by fertilizers, is a major cause of global warming.

                <h7 class="intro-text left-align">5. Waste and Pollution</h7>
                <p>
                    Methane emissions from landfills are caused by poor waste management, and the manufacture and disposal of single-use plastics pollute the land and oceans, upsetting ecosystems and increasing the risks of climate change.

                <p>
                    CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-powered vehicles are substantial. With more automobiles, aircraft, and ships in operation globally, transportation continues to be a significant contributor to emissions.
