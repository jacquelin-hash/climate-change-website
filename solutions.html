            <p>
                We might never fully know. With corporations holding so much power over industries that pollute the planet, 
                it feels like individual actions might not be enough. As much as we recycle and clean up the earth, fast fashion is still thriving. 
                Even your favorite celebrities—like Taylor Swift—are contributing to the problem, with their private jets and unsustainable lifestyles.
            </p>
            <h3 class="intro-text">What’s Holding Us Back?</h3>
            <p>
                Large corporations dominate industries responsible for high carbon emissions—such as oil, gas, fast fashion, and agriculture. 
                Despite public pressure, these companies often avoid sustainable changes in favor of profit. They contribute to greenwashing, 
                misleading consumers into believing products are environmentally friendly. While individuals are encouraged to recycle and buy green, 
                these small actions alone cannot solve a problem created on such a massive scale.

            <p>
                The Union Square Climate Clock reminds us that we only have 5 years to act before it’s too late. 
                It’s a sobering reminder that time is running out. What are we doing with the time we have left? 
                Are we holding the right people and industries accountable, or are we being distracted by the idea that individual actions alone can save the planet?

            <h5 class="intro-text">The Time To Act Now</h5>
            <p>
                We must urge that companies take the lead in implementing sustainable practices in order to undo the harm. Every 
                decision we make, whether it’s to hold businesses responsible or to support environmentally friendly brands, contributes to the creation of a sustainable future. Neither we nor the climate crisis will wait.
