                The world is gradually collapsing as we go about our daily lives due to extreme weather events including flooding, devastating fires, increasing sea levels, and rising temperatures. These concerning events happening in our world are an indication of the long-term changes caused by climate change, which is permanently altering our world. A large portion of the blame for environmental harm has been unjustly shifted to consumers throughout this environmental crisis. We are frequently thrown information about the increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by our daily activities, consumption of commodities linked to deforestation, and reliance on fossil fuels. Though individual accountability is important, large organizations are really to blame for their industrial methods, extensive deforestation, and stubbornness for more profit.

                These corporations dominate the industrial, large-scale agricultural, and oil and gas sectors, which account for the vast majority of global emissions. By blaming individual people, they avoid taking responsibility and divert attention away from the structural changes needed to address the root causes of climate change. Why are we, the customers, getting all the blame when these companies are the ones wreaking such massive damage to the environment? What actions can we as a society and as individuals take to hold these corporations accountable for their role in the crisis and to put pressure on them to take decisive action to restore the earth to a more sustainable and balanced state? The capacity to insist on changing the subject.
